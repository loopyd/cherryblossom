# CherryBLOOM
## The automated lazy tiger fuck

Hello and welcome to CherryBlossom.  CherryBlossom is a thing.

What this unlocks is some god-tier stuff.  Like me, a single python programmer, being McGiever.

## Setting it up

1.  You just need to pay the $9 to huggingface for a Pro account to get started, and then you can start generating code with this repository for yourself.  The 30k will get eaten up quickly on the free account.
2.  Generate a read-only token from huggingface, and edit ``config.json``. 

There's other shit in here, like minexec.cmd -- a useful win.exe conda runner.  But, as I'm lazy and fat, I'm also troo lazy and fat to document it.

## What in the f@#k???

Yes, AI can STUFF your other AI for you.  You can fuck around with the code.

## Holy Crap!

I am not responsible for soiled trousers as a result of using this repository to write your prompts for you, and it actually producing awful shit.

[Give](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/snowflowerwolf) me all of your donation money.
