## 3. LICENSE TERMS

Being a "dick" includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1.  Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.  That defines you as a "LAZY dick".
2.  Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's "REALLY being a dick".
3.  Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content.  That would make you a "PROPER dick".
4.  If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love.  Only a "MICRO dick" would make loads off this work and not buy the original  work's creator(s) a pint (a. k. a.:  make a reasonable donation to them)
5.  Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a "DONKEY dick". Fix the problem yourself.  A non-dick would offer the fix back to the creator to improve the original work.
